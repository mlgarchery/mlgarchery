# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mlgarchery

I am a french developer at [Unyc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/unyc-io/).
I have experience in web, ML and gamedev.

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently very interested in 

DeFi, and how to build and use smart contracts. EVM compatible blockchain and the Solidity langage are becoming a standard in the field, so I am working on learning more on that.

On April 14th, during a the [PBWS](https://www.pbwsummit.com/) hackathon, my team won second place pitching [DeSplit](https://design.penpot.app/#/view/a576ff40-b9d3-11ec-862a-da95c03a630b?page-id=a576ff41-b9d3-11ec-862a-da95c03a630b&section=interactions&index=0&share-id=527ff830-bbf6-11ec-862a-da95c03a630b).
