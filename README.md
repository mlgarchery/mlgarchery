# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mlgarchery

I am a french developer at [Unyc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/unyc-io/).
I have experience in web, ML and gamedev.

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently very interested in 

DeFi, and how to build and use smart contracts. EVM compatible blockchain and the Solidity langage are becoming a standard in the field, so I am working on learning more on that.

Besides having jumped into cryptos investing some money, back in 2017, I recently read more on the subject, and made changes in my learning process, getting my hands dirty, most notably so far:

- During the weekend of March 10th, I made a [PoW blockchain](https://github.com/ProjectBabbage/babbagecoin) from scratch with some friends and family members.
- On April 14th, during a the [PBWS](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/constantin-picoron-16b841131_hackathon-blockchain-activity-6922567479818924035-7A4Z?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) hackathon, my team won second place pitching [DeSplit](https://design.penpot.app/#/view/a576ff40-b9d3-11ec-862a-da95c03a630b?page-id=a576ff41-b9d3-11ec-862a-da95c03a630b&section=interactions&index=0&share-id=527ff830-bbf6-11ec-862a-da95c03a630b), a splitting expense dApp.
